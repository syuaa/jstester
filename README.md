Welcome to JsTester
===================

Another super simple small offline tool to help developers to test javascript, css, and html script. JsFiddle is the idea but JsTester work offline and not prepared for live system.
HTML script will generate under HTML5 doctype, if you need something like XHTML, then you need to modify `static/protal.js` script.

Quick start
-----------

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/syuaa/jstester.git .` to your localhost directory.
- Run it from your browser.
- Fill the tab HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tab with your script. Additionally, you also may fill the Header tab to fill script inside tag `<head>` and `</head>`.
- Click button Run.

Bug Reporting
-------------

Find any? If you can fix it ( which I believe you can ), then fix it. Do not forget to push it so other downloader get the fixed one.
